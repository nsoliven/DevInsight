### Summary
When we analyze an algorithm, we determine its [[Time Complexity]] to understand how it performs. This helps us predict the efficiency and suitability for different tasks.

We analyze an algorithms Time Complexity using [[Asymptotic Notation]] based on their performance as input sizes grow in the with an Upper Bound, Lower Bound, Exact Bound and etc. This classification helps compare and choose the best algorithm for a given problem.
