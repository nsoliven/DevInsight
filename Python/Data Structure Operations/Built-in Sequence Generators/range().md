Generates a sequence of numbers.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
# Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

for i in range(2, 8, 2):
    print(i)
# Output: 2, 4, 6
```

Key points:
- Can specify start, stop, and step
- Commonly used in for loops
- Returns a range object (not a list)
- Memory-efficient for large sequences
